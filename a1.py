MY ORIGINAL AI PROMPT:
"I am a high school student with a background in java programming, but have no prior experience with python. Create a problem set of 5-7 questions that cover the basics of python a beginner needs to know. Assume knowledge of programming concepts, but not how concepts are applied to python."

Example: "I'm learning Python basics in a high school programming class. 
I have some experience with Java. Can you create 5-7 practice problems that cover..."

"""
PROBLEM 1: Variables & Types
 Write a Python program that declares the following:
    A string variable name set to "Alice",
    An integer age set to 17,
    A float gpa set to 3.8,
    A boolean is_honor_student set to True.

Then, print all of them in a formatted sentence.
ðŸ§ª Test: Output should be:
 "Alice is 17 years old, has a GPA of 3.8, and honor student status is True."

PROBLEM 2: Conditionals
 Write a Python function grade_level(age) that returns:
    "Elementary" if age < 11,
    "Middle" if 11 <= age < 14,
    "High School" if 14 <= age < 18,
    "College" otherwise.
"""
def grade_level(age: int): #-> str :
    if age < 11:
        return("Elementary")
    elif 11<= age < 14:
        return("Middle") 
    elif 14<= age < 18:
        return("High School")
    else:
        return ("College")

"""
ðŸ§ª Test Cases:
 grade_level(10) â†’ "Elementary"
 grade_level(13) â†’ "Middle"
 grade_level(17) â†’ "High School"
 grade_level(19) â†’ "College"

PROBLEM 3: Loops and Ranges 
 Write a function sum_even_numbers(n) that returns the sum of all even numbers from 0 to n (inclusive).
ðŸ’¡ Use a for loop and range()
 ðŸ§ª Example: sum_even_numbers(10) should return 30 (0+2+4+6+8+10)
 """

def sum_even_numbers(n: int):
    total = 0
    # for num in range(n+1):
    #     total


    return total

"""
PROBLEM 4: Lists and Slicing
Given a list of test scores: scores = [88, 92, 79, 93, 85] 
Write Python code to: 
Print the last score,
Print the top 3 scores,
Add a new score 90, 
Sort the list in descending order.
ðŸ§ª Output should reflect proper list indexing, slicing, append(), and sort() usage.

PROBLEM 5: Functions and String Manipulation
Write a function reverse_words(sentence) that:
    Takes a string sentence,
    Splits it into words,
    Reverses the order of words,
    Returns the new sentence.
ðŸ§ª Example:
    reverse_words("I love Python") â†’ "Python love I"
 
PROBLEM 6: 
    
Example:
Problem: Write a function called 'is_even' that takes an integer and returns 
True if the number is even, False if it's odd.

Example inputs/outputs:
- is_even(4) should return True
- is_even(7) should return False

"""
Test all your solutions with different inputs

Add asserts if you feel comfortable

Example:
print("Testing Problem 1:")
print(f"is_even(4): {is_even(4)}")  # Should print True
print(f"is_even(7): {is_even(7)}")  # Should print False
"""
